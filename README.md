# MarsRovers

This project was built using a .NET core console application. It creates Mars Rover "vehicle" that can be given a grid, a location on that grid, and a set of instructions to execute.

### Assumptions for this project:
1. The area the rover is investigating is a rectangular plateau.
2. A rover has three potential instructions: turn left, turn right, move forward
3. Two rovers are exploring the plateau area, the first finishing its pattern before the second begins.

### Notes
I used a console application for this project for ease of use and simplicity of code demonstration. Input validation was an important aspect here since I could not manage a static input like I would if I were using a web page. Several input validation methods were created to neaten up the Main() method. 

This was my first project implementing unit tests. I am not familiar with best practices yet, but am excited to continue to develop this skill. I would appreciate any feedback on ways to create better, or more functional tests.
